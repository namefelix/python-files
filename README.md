Some little python projects I made.

## Data Mining Project
```Titanic_dataset``` and ```Adult cencus_dataset``` contain mini-projects from the 2019 "Data mining" class.

Performing classification on the [Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) and [Adult Cencus Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/20/census+income) with simple data preprocessing and ```scikit-learn``` module.

## Image Processing Project
```Image Processing Playground``` and ```Road sign recognition``` contain mini-projects from the 2021 "Image Processing" class.

Image Processing Playground allows users to perform simple image processing such as histogram equalization, wavelet transform, and convolution.

Road Sign Recognition performs recognition tasks with simple image preprocessing and ```skimage``` module.

## Debugging

The debugging assignment is also included here.
